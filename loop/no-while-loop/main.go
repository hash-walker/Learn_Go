There Is No While Loop in Go
Most programming languages have a concept of a while loop. Because Go allows for the omission of sections of a for loop, a while loop is just a for loop that only has a CONDITION.

for CONDITION {
  // do some stuff while CONDITION is true
}

For example:

plantHeight := 1
for plantHeight < 5 {
  fmt.Println("still growing! current height:", plantHeight)
  plantHeight++
}
fmt.Println("plant has grown to ", plantHeight, "inches")
Copy icon
Which prints:

still growing! current height: 1
still growing! current height: 2
still growing! current height: 3
still growing! current height: 4
plant has grown to 5 inches

Assignment
We have an interesting new cost structure from our SMS vendor. They charge exponentially more money for each consecutive text we send! Letâ€™s write a function that calculates how many messages we can send in a given batch given a costMultiplier and a maxCostInPennies.

In a nutshell, the first message costs a penny, and each message after that costs the same as the previous message multiplied by the costMultiplier.

There is a bug in the code! Add a condition to the for loop to fix the bug. The loop should stop when balance is equal to or less than 0. So what condition should the for loop evaluate?

package main


func getMaxMessagesToSend(costMultiplier float64, maxCostInPennies int) int {
	actualCostInPennies := 1.0
	maxMessagesToSend := 1
	balance := float64(maxCostInPennies) - actualCostInPennies
	for balance >= 0.0 {
		actualCostInPennies *= costMultiplier
		balance -= actualCostInPennies
		maxMessagesToSend++
	}
	if balance < 0.0 {
		maxMessagesToSend--
	}
	return maxMessagesToSend
}
